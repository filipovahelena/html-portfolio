<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Helena and I am 24 years old. I live in Prague, but I used to live in Frydlant where I was also born. I went to grammar school in Frydlant for 8 years. Then
  I met my boyfriend and now we live together with our dog called Harley in a small flat in Prague 5.

<p>My biggest hobby is music. I've been playing the piano for more than a decade. I also like sports. When I was a teenager, I hated sports because of P.E. at school.
  Now I go to gym almost every day. I work out when sick, when happy... All the time.

<p>My favourite being on the Earth is my dog Harley. She is 2 years old and she is just the best.</p>
